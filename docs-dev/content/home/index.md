## Primary Objective

Welcome to Okapi! This library is designed to make modeling and programming complex robot behavior easy, efficient, and maintainable. This library is targeted at PROS users looking to take their competition robot to the next level, whether that means starting to use motion profiles instead of PID or designing an autonomous robot from the ground up. Okapi also comes with an optional cross-platform client that lets you interact with your robot in real time as a graphical interface to Okapi's modules.

This is the documentation website for both Okapi's PROS library and optional client.

## Target Audience

Okapi is targeted at users of PROS that are familiar with C++ programming. If you are not comfortable with PROS, there are tutorials on the [PROS website](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu), and those still learning C++ should look towards [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/) and [Washington University](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/C++/).
